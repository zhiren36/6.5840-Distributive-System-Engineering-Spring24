Lecture 7

Question: I am wondering what the state "votedFor" stored in Raft server is used for. My understanding from the paper is that whenever a requestVote RPC is sent to a Raft server, votedFor is used to determine whether the vote will be granted (like if the receiver has already voted for another server in the same term, then vote will not be granted). However, isn't it easier to just check for the terms? Whenever a server is contacted by requestVote RPC, it simply checks if the sender's term is larger than it's own term. If it is, a vote is granted and the receiver increases its term to be the same as the sender's term. (will probably ask this on piazza as well).
