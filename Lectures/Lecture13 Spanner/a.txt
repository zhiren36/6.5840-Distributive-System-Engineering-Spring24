Lecture 13

Spanner Suppose a Spanner server's TT.now() returns correct information, but the uncertainty is large. For example, suppose the absolute time is 10:15:30, and TT.now() returns the interval [10:15:20,10:15:40]. That interval is correct in that it contains the absolute time, but the error bound is 10 seconds. See Section 3 for an explanation TT.now(). What bad effect will a large error bound have on Spanner's operation? Give a specific example.



Answer: If the uncertainty is large, Spanner slows down to wait out that uncertainty, which can cause performance issues.
