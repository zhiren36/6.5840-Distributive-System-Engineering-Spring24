Lecture 8

Could a received InstallSnapshot RPC cause the state machine to go backwards in time? That is, could step 8 in Figure 13 cause the state machine to be reset so that it reflects fewer executed operations? If yes, explain how this could happen. If no, explain why it can't happen.



Answer: This could not happen because the index that keeps track of snapshots is usually less than commit index. Snapshotting will not cause state machine to go backwards in time.
